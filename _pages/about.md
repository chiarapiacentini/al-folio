I am a postdoctoral research fellow in the in the Toronto Intelligent Decision Engineering Laboratory at the University of Toronto. My current research focuses on the use of Mixed Integer Programming and Constraint Programming techniques for AI planning with time and resources.


I obtained her Ph.D. from King's College London working under the supervision of Maria Fox and Derek Long. During my Ph.D., I worked on various projects based on the application of AI planning and scheduling to real-world problems. These involve non-linear numeric effects, discrete optimization, and probabilistic reasoning, particularly in the area of smart grid and search and track missions.
